# CodeTribe Academy Marketplace MVP

## Project Overview

CodeTribe Academy is launching an online marketplace where users can list and browse products for sale. This MVP (Minimum Viable Product) application is built using Node.js for the backend and React.js for the frontend.

The project is divided into two main parts:
- Backend: RESTful API for product management, user authentication, and data handling.
- Frontend: User interface for registration, product browsing, cart management, and checkout.
